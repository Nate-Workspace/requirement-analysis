## What is Requirement Analysis?

Requirement Analysis, or Requirements Engineering, is the vital SDLC phase focused on understanding, documenting, and validating stakeholder needs for a software system. It defines what the system should do through active collaboration.

### Key Activities:
Elicitation (Gathering): Discovering requirements through interviews, surveys, workshops, use cases, etc.
Analysis & Modeling: Organizing and representing requirements using techniques like use case diagrams and user stories.
Specification (Documentation): Formally documenting requirements in a Software Requirements Specification (SRS).
Validation: Ensuring requirements accurately reflect stakeholder needs through reviews and prototyping.
Management: Controlling changes to requirements throughout the SDLC.

## Why is Requirement Analysis Important?
Provides a clear foundation for the project.
Reduces development costs by identifying issues early.
Improves software quality by ensuring the system meets user needs.
Minimizes scope creep through a well-defined scope.
Enhances communication among stakeholders.
Enables better planning and estimation.
Facilitates effective testing.
Increases user satisfaction.

In essence, thorough Requirement Analysis is essential for building successful software that meets stakeholder needs and delivers value, preventing costly errors and ensuring a focused development process.
